![Gif of all shader graphs in use. At the bottom of the screen, ocean waves roll. Above it are three spheres. The first has a gentle glow. The second has a pulsing glow. The third looks like it is disintigrating. To the top-left of the spheres are two ice cubes. To the right og them are a lavender cube and sphere.](Screenshots/all_shaders.gif)
