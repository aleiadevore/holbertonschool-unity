# 0x05. Unity - Assets: Models, Textures

This is the final version of the platformer game first created in [this directory](../0x05-unity-assets_models_textures). Building on [Unity Animation](../0x07-unity-animation), I created audio for the game and created a user interface so that players can save their audio preferences.
