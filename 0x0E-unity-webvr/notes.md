# Notes

# Environment setup
- First going to export sample scene as WebGL build to make sure I can interact with it as expected.
    - Build is set up in [this repo](https://aleiadevore.github.io/Web_VR_Build/).
    - Need to look into docs for WebXR export to make sure I'm setting it up correctly. Right now it has the correct footer, but nothing is loading.
    - Switching compression methods didn't fix the issue
# Ideas
- Grass shader graph [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDpt9xYaUYc&ab_channel=NedMakesGames)
- Could use this as base environment for capstone
