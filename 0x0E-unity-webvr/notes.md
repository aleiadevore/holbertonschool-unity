# Notes

# Environment setup
- First going to export sample scene as WebGL build to make sure I can interact with it as expected.
    - Build is set up in [this repo](https://aleiadevore.github.io/Web_VR_Build/).
    - Need to look into docs for WebXR export to make sure I'm setting it up correctly. Right now it has the correct footer, but nothing is loading.
