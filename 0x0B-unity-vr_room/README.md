## About
This directory contains files for a VR escape room. A development journal for this project can be found [here](Progress_log.md).

## Make it accessible
Once the basics are complete, try to:
- [ ] Create sound cues for interactable objects
- [ ] Check for color cues. Are they color blind safe colors?
- [ ] Raycast continually flashing between valid and nonvalid is nausiating. Figure out what's going on with it.
